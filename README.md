## Disclaimers
1. The project is for practice / learning purposes - any comments / suggestions will be appreciated.
2. Currently there is the most basic UI, PR's welcome :)
3. The testing is very minimal and not very clean, Suggestions on how to make mocks behave nicely with Typescript will be appreciated.
4. In development the project is using mock services, but the initializations is done in runtime and not in compile / transpile time which is less nice.
